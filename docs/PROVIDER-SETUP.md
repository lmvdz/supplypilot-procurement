# SupplyPilot: private provider setup

Run node scripts/setup-private.mjs once. It prepares an ignored .dev.vars file and generates an owner access key if absent. Existing keys are preserved. Edit this file locally; never paste secrets into a chat, a public repository, a URL, or Devpost.

## AI

Set AI_MODE=openrouter and OPENROUTER_API_KEY to your existing server-held key. Keep AI_PRIMARY_MODEL=liquid/lfm-2.5-2.6b:free and AI_ALLOW_PAID_FALLBACK=false. The adapter enforces a zero-price route. Use only the built-in synthetic examples; the input boundary is documented in README. Restart locally or redeploy after editing. A configured badge is not proof of a successful call. Record the UI's actual provider/model result and sanitized time/HTTP outcome; never record request headers or keys.

## PayPal sandbox

Set PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID and PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET from an existing sandbox business REST application. Only sandbox endpoints are implemented. Set PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox. Approve an exact quote, choose Sandbox checkout, complete approval with a sandbox buyer account, and capture the approved order. The quote total, currency, lines and correlation are verified server-side. Keep an uncertain checkout visible and reconcile it; a redirect is not a completed receipt.

Use a separate sandbox buyer to approve orders; enter buyer credentials only on PayPal's sandbox pages. No production payment or real fulfillment is part of this prototype. Record sanitized order/capture/refund references, exact USD amount, final provider status and time as verification evidence. Mock tests do not count as this evidence.

## Hosting and judge access

SITE_OWNER_KEY protects the single-owner state and mutation APIs. Supply the access key privately in Devpost's judge testing instructions or by the organizer's approved private channel. Leave the public overview accessible. Keep hosting and judge access available through the official judging period, currently December 15, 2026. Payment and AI keys remain server bindings and are never shared with judges. Signing out clears the two-hour cookie; changing the access key revokes existing sessions.

## Current evidence limit

Live schema-validated OpenRouter inference was verified through this protected hosted app with the zero-price Liquid model. The hosted application completed an actual $201.66 sandbox test-card capture. PayPal order/capture status and the exact USD amount were verified; one durable receipt and one stock deduction were observed, and duplicate capture reused that receipt. Wallet buyer approval/return UX remains unverified. Public YouTube demonstrations, final judge access and eligibility/submission requirements remain open. These results establish sandbox behavior, not production readiness. Sanitized receipts are in evidence/.
